# Orcus RAT's SRC

Orcus.Administration won't build because of errors I can't be bothered to fix, every other major project builds fine. 

Support will not be provided, don't contact me.

Github won't let me upload the zip because it's too big. Download Link: https://anonfiles.com/n6E7T4rbu2/Orcus-1.9.1_SRC_-_Fixed_7z
